## IMPROVE Framework 

Within the IMPROVE project, we address some of the challenges around model comparisons, dataset standardization, and availability through the development and provision of a software framework. The goal is to make it routine practice for the broader community (cancer research and other areas) to compare new machine learning modeling approaches to previous models rigorously and comprehensively.

You can take a look at our [documentation](https://jdacs4c-improve.github.io/docs/) for more information about the project and examples of applying the framework.
